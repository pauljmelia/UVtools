- (Add) Exposure time finder: Re-arrange exposure text layout and allow to change it font (#955)
- (Add) Setting: Available RAM lower limit - Sets a lower limiter for the available memory RAM the program is allowed to run operations. (#953)  
                   When meet the threshold, a stopping action will be queued to relief pressure and maintain the system stability.  
                   In cases where is unable to pause or cancel the operation, the program will be forced to close and trigger an exception to ensure the system stability.  
                   Note: This limiter will check the RAM every 2 seconds while operations are running, if you have set a very low limit there is a chance to consume more RAM in the time and cause system instability.  
                   System can also reserve some RAM to prevent depletion and start to use SWAP memory, doing such with a low limit and is possible that the limiter never trigger.  
                   0: Ignore the RAM limiter.

- (Upgrade) AvaloniaUI from 11.0.7 to 11.0.9

## 29/01/2024 - v4.2.0

- **Layers:**
  - (Add) Brotli compression codec with good performance and compression ratio (Choose it if you have low available RAM)
  - (Improvement) Use `RecyclableMemoryStream` instead of `MemoryStream` for `GZip` and `Deflate` compressions, this results in faster compressions and less memory pressure
  - (Improvement) Changed how layers are cached into the memory, before they were compressed and save for the whole image. Now it crops the bitmap to the bounding rectangle of the current layer and save only that portion with pixels.  
                  For example, if the image is empty the cached size will be 0 bytes, and in a 12K image but with a 100 x 100 usable area it will save only that area instead of requiring a 12K buffer.  
                  The size of the buffer is now dynamic and will depends on layer data, as so, this method can reduce the memory usage greatly, specially when using large images with a lot of empty space, but also boosts the overall performance by relief the allocations and the required memory footprint.  
                  Only in few special cases can have drawbacks, however they are very minimal and the performance impact is minimal in that case.  
                  When decompressing, the full resolution image is still created and then the cached area is imported to the corresponding position, composing the final and original image. This is still faster than the old method because decompress a larger buffer is more costly.  
                  In the end both writes/compresses and reads/decompresses are now faster and using less memory.
                  Note: When printing multiple objects it is recommended to place them close to each other as you can to take better advantage of this new method.

                              This is not so important when your model print raised under a raft/supports unaffected by the bottom exposure, in that case, it's fine to ignore this.
   - (Add) Model position: Printing on a corner will reduce the FEP stretch forces when detaching from the model during a lift sequence, benefits are: Reduced lift height and faster printing, less stretch, less FEP marks, better FEP lifespan, easier to peel, less prone to failure and use the screen pixels more evenly.
                           If the model is too large to fit within the margin(s) on the screen, it will attempt to center it on that same axis to avoid touching on screen edge(s) and to give a sane margin from it.

## 12/03/2022 - v3.0.0

- **(Add) Suggestions:**
   - A new module that detect bad or parameters out of a defined range and suggest a change on the file, those can be auto applied if configured to do so
   - **Available suggestions:**
      - **Bottom layer count:** Bottom layers should be kept to a minimum, usually from 2 to 3, it function is to provide a good adhesion to the first layer on the build plate, using a high count have disadvantages.  
      - **Wait time before cure:** Rest some time before cure the layer is crucial to let the resin settle after the lift sequence and allow some time for the arm settle at the correct Z position as the resin will offer some resistance and push the structure.  
                                   This lead to better quality with more successful prints, less lamination problems, better first layers with more success of stick to the build plate and less elephant foot effect.
      - **Wait time after cure:** Rest some time after cure the layer and before the lift sequence can be important to allow the layer to cooldown a bit and detach better from the FEP.
      - **Layer height:** Using the right layer height is important to get successful prints:  
                          Thin layers may cause problems on adhesion, lamination, will print much slower and have no real visual benefits.  
                          Thick layers may not fully cure no matter the exposure time you use, causing lamination and other hazards. Read your resin dtasheet to know the limits.  
                          Using layer height with too many decimal digits may produce a wrong positioning due stepper step loss and/or Z axis quality.

## 14/10/2020 - v0.8.6.0

* (Change) Island detection system:
  * **Before**: A island is consider safe by just have a static amount of pixels, this mean it's possible to have a mass with 100000px supported by only 10px (If safe pixels are configured to this value), so there's no relation with island size and it supporting size. This leads to a big problem and not detecting some potential/unsafe islands.
  * **Now:** Instead of a static number of safe pixels, now there's a multiplier value, which will multiply the island total pixels per the multiplier, the supporting pixels count must be higher than the result of the multiplication.
    *  **Formula:** Supporting pixels >= Island pixels * multiplier
    *  **Example:** Multiplier of 0.25, an island with 1000px * 0.25 = 250px, so this island will not be considered if below exists at least 250px to support it, otherwise will be flagged as an island.
    *  **Notes:** This is a much more fair system but still not optimal, bridges and big planes with micro supports can trigger false islands. While this is a improvement over old system it's not perfect and you probably will have islands which you must ignore. Renember that you not have to clear out the issue list! Simply step over and ignore the issues you think are false-positives.

## 04/09/2020 - v0.7.0.0

* (Add) "Rebuild GCode" button
* (Add) Issues: Touching Bounds and Empty Layers to the detect button
* (Add) Mutator - Pixel Dimming: Dims only the borders (Suggested by Marco Borzacconi)
* (Add) Mutator - Pixel Dimming: "Solid" button to set brightness only
* (Add) Issue Highlighting
  * Issues selected from the issue List View are now painted in an alternate configurable highlight color to distinguish them from non-selected issues.
  * Issues are now made active as soon as they are selected in the issue list, so single-click or arrow keys can now be used to select and issue. Double-click is no longer required.
  * Multi-select is supported. All selected issues on the currently visible layer will be highlighted with the appropriate highlight color.
  * When an issue is selected, if it is already visible in the layer preview, it will be highlighted, but not moved. If an issue is not visible when selected, it's layer will be made active (in necessary) and it will be centered in the layer preview to make it visible.
  * Issues can be selected directly from layer preview by double clicking or SHIFT+Left click on it (Hand mouse icon), also will be highlighted on issue list (This will not work while on pixel editor mode)
* (Add) Edit Pixel Operation Highlighting
  * Similar to issue highlighting, pending operations in the pixel edit view will be highlighted in an alternate configurable color when they are selected from the operations List View, including multi-select support.
  * Unlike issue highlighting, when an operation is selected from the List View, it will always be centered in the layer preview window, even if it is already visible on screen. A future update could be smarter about this and handle operations similar to issues (determining bounds of operations is a bit more involved than determining bounds of an issue).
* (Add) Crosshair Support
  * Cross-hairs can now be displayed to identify the exact location of each selected issue in the layer preview window. This is particularly beneficial at lower zoom levels to identify where issues are located within the overall layer.
  * Multi-select is supported, so selecting multiple issues will render multiple cross-hairs, one per issue.
  * Cross-hairs can be enabled/disabled on-demand using a tool strip button next to the issues button.
  * Cross-hairs can be configured to automatically fade at a specific zoom level, so that they are visible when zoomed-out, but disappear when zoomed in and issue highlighting is more obvious. The Zoom-level at which the fade occurs is configurable in settings.
  * Cross-hairs are visible in Pixel Edit mode, but they are linked to selected issues in the issues tab, not selected pixel operations in the pixel edit tab. Cross-hairs will automatically fade when an add/remove operation is initiated (via SHIFT key).
* (Add) Configurable auto-zoom level support
  * The zoom level used for auto-zoom operations is now configurable. It can be changed at any time by zooming to the desired level in the layer preview and double-clicking or CTRL-clicking the middle mouse button.
  * The currently selected auto-zoom level is indicated by a "lock" icon that appears next to the current zoom level indicator in the tool strip.
  * The default auto-zoom level (used on startup) can be configured in settings.
* (Add) Mouse-Based Navigation updates for the issue list, layer preview and pixel edit mode.
  * Issue List
     * Single Left or Right click now selects an issue from the issues list. If auto-zoom is enabled, the issue will also be centered and zoomed. Holding ALT will invert the configured behavior in your settings. With these navigation updates, leaving auto-zoom disabled in settings is recommended (and is now the new default).
     * Double-Left click or CTRL-Left-click on an issue in the issue list will zoom in on that specific issue.
     * Double-Right click or CTRL-Right-Click on any issue will zoom to fit either the build plate or the print bounds, depending on your settings. Holding ALT during the click operation will perform the inverse zoom action from what is configured in your settings(zoom plate vs zoom print bounds).
     * The Prev/Next buttons at the top of the Layer Preview will now auto-repeat if held down (similar to the layer scroll bar).
  * Layer Preview
     * Clicking in the Layer Preview window will allow you to grab and pan the image (unchanged behavior)
     * Double-Left clicking or CTRL-click on any point within the Layer Preview window will zoom in on that specific point using the locked auto-zoom level.
     * Double-Right click or CTRL-click in the layer preview will zoom-to-fit. Same behavior as double-left-click on an issue in the issue list.
     * Hold middle mouse button for 1 second will set the auto-zoom-level to the current zoom level.
     * Mouse wheel scroll behavior is unchanged (wheel scrolls in/out)
  * Pixel Edit Mode
     * Single click left or right in the pixel operation list view will now select an operation. Double click does the same (advanced zoom operations described for issue list are not currently supported from the operation list).
     * When Pixel Edit Mode is active, mouse operations in the Layer Preview area generally behave the same as described in the Layer Preview section above, including pan and double-click zoom in/out.
     * Pressing the SHIFT key in layer edit mode activates the ability to perform add/remove operations, while shift is pressed the cursor icon changes to a cross-hair, and add/remove operations can be performed. In this mode, pan and double-click zoom operations are disabled. Releasing the shift key will end add/remove mode and restore pan/zoom functions.
     * Shift-Left-Click will perform an add operations (add pixel, text, etc).
     * Shift-Right-Click will perform a remove operation (remove pixel, etc).
* (Change) Mouse coordinates on status bar now only change when SHIFT key is press, this allow to lock a position for debug
* (Remove) Confirmation for detect issues as they can now be canceled
* (Fix) When next layer or previous layer button got disabled while pressing it get stuck
* (Fix) Partial island detection wasn't checking next layer as it should
* (Fix) chitubox: Keep some original values when read from chitubox sliced files
* (Fix) chitubox: Preview thumbnails to respect order and size names
